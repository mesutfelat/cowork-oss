```

CoWork-OSS is an open-source, local-first agent workbench for running multi-step tasks in a folder-scoped workspace, with explicit approvals for destructive actions and built-in skills for generating documents, spreadsheets, and presentations.

**You bring your own model credentials (Anthropic API / Google Gemini / OpenRouter / AWS Bedrock) or run locally with Ollama; usage is billed by your provider (or free with Ollama).**

> **Independent project.** CoWork-OSS is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Anthropic.
> This project implements a local, folder-scoped agent workflow pattern in open source.

**Status**: macOS desktop app (cross-platform support planned).

## ⚠️ Safety & Data Loss Warning

**CoWork-OSS can modify, move, overwrite, or delete files** as part of normal operation — or due to bugs, misuse, or unexpected AI behavior. Before using this software, please understand and follow these guidelines:

1. **Use a separate environment when possible.** Run CoWork-OSS on a dedicated Mac, a separate user account, or a virtual machine to isolate it from your primary data.

2. **Work only in non-critical folders.** If you cannot use a separate environment, select only folders you can afford to lose. **Never point CoWork-OSS at important personal files, system folders, or production data.**

3. **Enable and verify backups before use.** Ensure Time Machine or another backup solution is running and has recent, verified backups. Test that you can restore files before relying on them.

4. **Review all approval requests carefully.** The agent will ask for permission before destructive operations, but approvals are your responsibility. Read what the agent wants to do before clicking "Approve."

5. **Expect the unexpected.** AI systems can behave unpredictably. Files may be modified or deleted even when you don't expect it. Treat every workspace as potentially at risk.

> **Disclaimer:** The maintainers and contributors of CoWork-OSS are **not responsible** for any data loss, file corruption, or other damage resulting from the use of this software. You use CoWork-OSS entirely at your own risk.

  <em>Terminal-inspired UI — because GUIs shouldn't feel like GUIs</em>
</p>

---

## Why CoWork-OSS?

- **CLI-style interface**: Terminal-inspired UI with monospace fonts, status indicators `[✓]`, and keyboard-friendly navigation
- **Local-first state**: Tasks/events/artifacts are stored locally in SQLite; model requests are sent to your configured provider (Anthropic/Bedrock). No telemetry by default
- **Folder-scoped security**: File operations are constrained to your selected workspace with path traversal protection
- **Permissioned execution**: Explicit user approval required for destructive operations (delete, bulk rename)
- **Transparent runtime**: Real-time timeline showing every step, tool call, and decision
- **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)**: Use your own API credentials — no proxy, no reselling

**Note**: Today CoWork-OSS enforces workspace boundaries in-app; a VM sandbox is on the roadmap.

---

## Providers & Costs (BYOK)

CoWork-OSS is **free and open source**. To run tasks, you must configure your own model credentials or use local models.

| Provider | Configuration | Billing |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| Anthropic API | Configure API key in Settings | Pay-per-token |
| Google Gemini | Configure API key in Settings | Pay-per-token (free tier available) |
| OpenRouter | Configure API key in Settings | Pay-per-token (multi-model access) |
| AWS Bedrock | Configure AWS credentials in Settings | Pay-per-token via AWS |
| Ollama (Local) | Install Ollama and pull models | **Free** (runs locally) |

**Your usage is billed directly by your provider.** CoWork-OSS does not proxy or resell model access. With Ollama, everything runs on your machine for free.

</p>

---

## Usage

### 1. Select a Workspace

On first launch, select a folder where CoWork-OSS can work. This folder will be:
- Mounted for read/write access
- Protected by permission boundaries
- Used as the working directory for all tasks

### 2. Create a Task

Click "New Task" and describe what you want to accomplish:

**Example Tasks:**
- "Organize my Downloads folder by file type"
- "Create a quarterly report spreadsheet with Q1-Q4 data"
- "Generate a presentation about our product roadmap"
- "Analyze these CSV files and create a summary document"

### 3. Monitor Execution

Watch the task timeline as the agent:
- Creates an execution plan
- Executes steps using available tools
- Requests approvals for destructive operations
- Produces artifacts (files)

<p align="center">
  <img src="screenshots/cowork-oss1.jpeg" alt="Task Completion" width="800">
  <br>
  <em>Task completion with verification and file tracking</em>
</p>

### 4. Approve Requests

When the agent needs to perform destructive actions, you'll see an approval dialog. Review the details and approve or deny.

---

## Security & Safety

> **See also:** [⚠️ Safety & Data Loss Warning](#%EF%B8%8F-safety--data-loss-warning) at the top of this document for critical safety guidelines.
>
> **For a comprehensive security guide**, see [SECURITY_GUIDE.md](SECURITY_GUIDE.md) which covers the app's permissions model, data storage, network connections, and best practices.

### Important Warnings

- **Don't point this at sensitive folders** — select only folders you're comfortable giving the agent access to
- **Use version control / backups** — always have backups of important files before running tasks
- **Review approvals carefully** — read what the agent wants to do before approving
- **Treat web content as untrusted input** — be cautious with tasks involving external data

### Workspace Boundaries

All file operations are constrained to the selected workspace folder. Path traversal attempts are rejected.

### Permission Model

```typescript
interface WorkspacePermissions {
  read: boolean;      // Read files
  write: boolean;     // Create/modify files
  delete: boolean;    // Delete files (requires approval)
  network: boolean;   // Network access (future)
  shell: boolean;     // Execute shell commands (requires approval)
}
```

### Approval Requirements

The following operations always require user approval:
- File deletion
- Shell command execution (when enabled)
- Bulk rename (>10 files)
- Network access beyond allowlist
- External service calls

---

## Configurable Guardrails

CoWork-OSS includes configurable safety guardrails that you can customize in **Settings > Guardrails**. These provide additional protection against runaway tasks, excessive costs, and dangerous operations.

### Available Guardrails

| Guardrail | Description | Default | Range |
|-----------|-------------|---------|-------|
| **Token Budget** | Limits total tokens (input + output) per task | 100,000 | 1K - 10M |
| **Cost Budget** | Limits estimated cost (USD) per task | $1.00 (disabled) | $0.01 - $100 |
| **Iteration Limit** | Limits LLM calls per task to prevent infinite loops | 50 | 5 - 500 |
| **Dangerous Command Blocking** | Blocks shell commands matching dangerous patterns | Enabled | On/Off + custom patterns |
| **File Size Limit** | Limits the size of files the agent can write | 50 MB | 1 - 500 MB |
| **Domain Allowlist** | Restricts browser automation to approved domains | Disabled | On/Off + domain list |

### Token & Cost Budgets

Token and cost budgets help prevent runaway tasks from consuming excessive resources:

- **Token Budget**: Tracks total input + output tokens across all LLM calls in a task
- **Cost Budget**: Calculates estimated cost based on model pricing (Claude, Gemini, GPT-4, Llama, etc.)

When a budget is exceeded, the task stops with a clear error message showing usage vs. limit.

### Dangerous Command Blocking

Built-in patterns block potentially destructive shell commands **before** they reach the approval dialog:

**Default blocked patterns:**
- `sudo` - Elevated privileges
- `rm -rf /` - Recursive deletion of root
- `mkfs` - Filesystem formatting
- `dd if=` - Direct disk writes
- Fork bombs - Process exhaustion attacks
- `curl|bash` - Piped execution from internet

You can add custom patterns (regex supported) to block additional commands specific to your environment.

### Domain Allowlist

When enabled, browser automation is restricted to approved domains only:

- Specify exact domains: `github.com`
- Use wildcards: `*.google.com` (matches all subdomains)
- Block all navigation when enabled with no domains configured

This prevents the agent from navigating to unexpected websites during browser automation tasks.

### Configuration

1. Open **Settings** (gear icon)
2. Navigate to the **Guardrails** tab
3. Enable/disable guardrails using toggle switches
4. Adjust values as needed
5. Add custom blocked patterns or allowed domains
6. Click **Save Settings**

Settings are stored locally and persist across app restarts.

---

## Web Search Integration

CoWork-OSS includes a multi-provider web search system that allows the agent to search the web for information during task execution. This is useful for tasks that require current information, research, or fact-checking.

### Supported Providers

| Provider | Search Types | Best For |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| **Tavily** | Web, News | AI-optimized search results, recommended for most use cases |
| **Brave Search** | Web, News, Images | Privacy-focused search with good coverage |
| **SerpAPI** | Web, News, Images | Google results via API, comprehensive coverage |
| **Google Custom Search** | Web, Images | Direct Google integration, requires Search Engine ID |

### Configuration

Configure search providers in the Settings UI:

1. Open **Settings** (gear icon)
2. Navigate to the **Web Search** tab
3. Enter your API key(s) for your preferred providers:
   - **Tavily** (recommended) - Get key from [tavily.com](https://tavily.com/)
   - **Brave Search** - Get key from [brave.com/search/api](https://brave.com/search/api/)
   - **SerpAPI** - Get key from [serpapi.com](https://serpapi.com/)
   - **Google Custom Search** - Get key and Search Engine ID from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
4. Select your **Primary Provider** - used for all searches by default
5. Optionally select a **Fallback Provider** - used automatically if primary fails
6. Click **Test** to verify connectivity
7. Save settings

The settings panel shows provider capabilities (web, news, images support) and configuration status.

### How the Agent Uses Search

When the `web_search` tool is available, the agent can:
- Search the web for current information
- Look up news articles on specific topics
- Find images (with supported providers)
- Research facts to complete tasks accurately

**Example tasks that benefit from web search:**
- "Research the latest trends in renewable energy and create a summary"
- "Find the current stock price of Apple and create a report"
- "Look up recent news about AI regulation"

### Fallback Behavior

When multiple providers are configured:
1. The **Primary Provider** is tried first
2. If it fails (network error, rate limit, etc.), the **Fallback Provider** is automatically used
3. This ensures reliable search even if one provider has issues

### Provider Auto-Detection

If no provider is explicitly selected, CoWork-OSS auto-detects available providers based on which ones have API keys configured in Settings, in this priority order:
1. Tavily
2. Brave
3. SerpAPI
4. Google (requires both API key and Search Engine ID)

---

## Ollama Integration (Local LLMs)

CoWork-OSS supports running local language models via Ollama, allowing you to use the agent completely offline and free of charge.

### Setting Up Ollama

#### 1. Install Ollama

Download and install from [ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai/):

```bash
# macOS (via Homebrew)
brew install ollama

# Or download directly from https://ollama.ai/download
```

#### 2. Pull a Model

```bash
# Recommended models for agent tasks
ollama pull llama3.2        # Fast, good for most tasks
ollama pull qwen2.5:14b     # Better reasoning
ollama pull deepseek-r1:14b # Strong coding abilities
```

#### 3. Start Ollama Server

```bash
ollama serve
# Server runs at http://localhost:11434
```

### Configuring in CoWork-OSS

1. Open **Settings** (gear icon)
2. Select **Ollama (Local)** as your provider
3. Optionally change the **Base URL** (defaults to `http://localhost:11434`)
4. If using a remote Ollama server with authentication, enter the **API Key**
5. Click **Refresh Models** to load available models
6. Select your preferred model from the dropdown
7. Click **Test Connection** to verify
8. Save settings

### Recommended Models

| Model | Size | Best For |
|-------|------|----------|
| `llama3.2` | 3B | Quick tasks, low memory |
| `llama3.2:70b` | 70B | Complex reasoning (needs ~40GB RAM) |
| `qwen2.5:14b` | 14B | Balanced performance |
| `deepseek-r1:14b` | 14B | Coding and technical tasks |
| `mistral` | 7B | General purpose |

### Notes

- **Performance**: Local models are slower than cloud APIs but completely private
- **Memory**: Larger models need more RAM (e.g., 14B models need ~16GB RAM)
- **Tool Calling**: Works best with models that support function calling (llama3.2, qwen2.5)
- **Offline**: Once models are downloaded, no internet connection is required

## OpenRouter Integration

CoWork-OSS supports OpenRouter, a multi-model API gateway that provides access to various AI models from different providers (Claude, GPT-4, Llama, Mistral, etc.) through a unified API.

### Setting Up OpenRouter

#### 1. Get an API Key

1. Go to [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/keys)
2. Create an account or sign in
3. Click **Create Key**
4. Copy the generated API key (starts with `sk-or-...`)

#### 2. Configure in CoWork-OSS

1. Open **Settings** (gear icon)
2. Select **OpenRouter** as your provider
3. Enter your API key
4. Click **Refresh Models** to load available models
5. Select your preferred model
6. Click **Test Connection** to verify
7. Save settings

### Available Models

OpenRouter provides access to many models, including:

| Model | Provider | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet` | Anthropic | Default. Balanced model |
| `anthropic/claude-3-opus` | Anthropic | Most capable Claude model |
| `openai/gpt-4o` | OpenAI | OpenAI's flagship model |
| `openai/gpt-4o-mini` | OpenAI | Fast and affordable |
| `google/gemini-pro-1.5` | Google | Google's advanced model |
| `meta-llama/llama-3.1-405b-instruct` | Meta | Largest open model |
| `mistralai/mistral-large` | Mistral | Mistral's flagship |
| `deepseek/deepseek-chat` | DeepSeek | Conversational model |

See all available models at [openrouter.ai/models](https://openrouter.ai/models)

### Benefits

- **Multi-Model Access**: Switch between models without changing API keys
- **Pay-As-You-Go**: Pay only for what you use
- **Model Variety**: Access models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and more
- **Unified API**: OpenAI-compatible API format

## Development

### Hot Reload

Development mode provides hot reload for both:
- React UI (Vite HMR)
- Electron main process (auto-restart on changes)

### Adding New Tools

1. Define tool schema in `tools/registry.ts`
2. Implement tool logic in `tools/file-tools.ts` or create new file
3. Register tool in `getTools()` method
4. Add execution handler in `executeTool()`

### Adding New Skills

1. Create skill implementation in `skills/` directory
2. Add skill tool definition in `tools/skill-tools.ts`
3. Implement the skill method in SkillTools class

## Troubleshooting

### "No LLM provider configured"

Open **Settings** (gear icon) and configure at least one LLM provider with your API credentials.

### Electron won't start

Clear cache and rebuild:
```bash
rm -rf node_modules dist
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Database locked

Close all instances of the app and delete the lock file:
```bash
rm ~/Library/Application\ Support/cowork-oss/cowork-oss.db-journal
```
