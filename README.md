```

CoWork-OSS is an open-source, local-first agent workbench for running multi-step tasks in a folder-scoped workspace, with explicit approvals for destructive actions and built-in skills for generating documents, spreadsheets, and presentations.

**You bring your own model credentials (Anthropic API / AWS Bedrock); usage is billed by your provider.**

> **Independent project.** CoWork-OSS is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Anthropic.
> This project implements a local, folder-scoped agent workflow pattern in open source.

**Status**: macOS desktop app (cross-platform support planned).

## Why CoWork-OSS?

- **CLI-style interface**: Terminal-inspired UI with monospace fonts, status indicators `[✓]`, and keyboard-friendly navigation
- **Local-first state**: Tasks/events/artifacts are stored locally in SQLite; model requests are sent to your configured provider (Anthropic/Bedrock). No telemetry by default
- **Folder-scoped security**: File operations are constrained to your selected workspace with path traversal protection
- **Permissioned execution**: Explicit user approval required for destructive operations (delete, bulk rename)
- **Transparent runtime**: Real-time timeline showing every step, tool call, and decision
- **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)**: Use your own API credentials — no proxy, no reselling

**Note**: Today CoWork-OSS enforces workspace boundaries in-app; a VM sandbox is on the roadmap.

---

## Providers & Costs (BYOK)

CoWork-OSS is **free and open source**. To run tasks, you must configure your own model credentials.

| Provider | Configuration | Billing |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| Anthropic API | Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env` | Pay-per-token |
| AWS Bedrock | Configure AWS credentials in Settings | Pay-per-token via AWS |

**Your usage is billed directly by your provider.** CoWork-OSS does not proxy or resell model access.

## Features

### Core Capabilities

- **Task-Based Workflow**: Multi-step task execution with plan-execute-observe loops
- **Workspace Management**: Sandboxed file operations within selected folders
- **Permission System**: Explicit approval for destructive operations
- **Skill System**: Built-in skills for creating professional outputs:
  - Spreadsheet creation (Excel format)
  - Document creation (Word/PDF)
  - Presentation creation (PowerPoint)
  - Folder organization
- **Real-Time Timeline**: Live activity feed showing agent actions and tool calls
- **Artifact Tracking**: All created/modified files are tracked and viewable

## Usage

### 1. Select a Workspace

On first launch, select a folder where CoWork-OSS can work. This folder will be:
- Mounted for read/write access
- Protected by permission boundaries
- Used as the working directory for all tasks

### 2. Create a Task

Click "New Task" and describe what you want to accomplish:

**Example Tasks:**
- "Organize my Downloads folder by file type"
- "Create a quarterly report spreadsheet with Q1-Q4 data"
- "Generate a presentation about our product roadmap"
- "Analyze these CSV files and create a summary document"

### 3. Monitor Execution

Watch the task timeline as the agent:
- Creates an execution plan
- Executes steps using available tools
- Requests approvals for destructive operations
- Produces artifacts (files)

<p align="center">

</p>

### 4. Approve Requests

When the agent needs to perform destructive actions, you'll see an approval dialog. Review the details and approve or deny.

---

## Security & Safety

### Important Warnings

- **Don't point this at sensitive folders** — select only folders you're comfortable giving the agent access to
- **Use version control / backups** — always have backups of important files before running tasks
- **Review approvals carefully** — read what the agent wants to do before approving
- **Treat web content as untrusted input** — be cautious with tasks involving external data

### Workspace Boundaries

All file operations are constrained to the selected workspace folder. Path traversal attempts are rejected.

### Permission Model

```typescript
interface WorkspacePermissions {
  read: boolean;      // Read files
  write: boolean;     // Create/modify files
  delete: boolean;    // Delete files (requires approval)
  network: boolean;   // Network access (future)
}
```

### Approval Requirements

The following operations always require user approval:
- File deletion
- Bulk rename (>10 files)
- Network access beyond allowlist
- External service calls

---

## Compliance

This project requires users to comply with their model provider's terms and policies:

- [Anthropic Commercial Terms of Service](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/commercial-terms)
- [Anthropic Usage Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/aup)
- [AWS Bedrock Third-Party Model Terms](https://aws.amazon.com/legal/bedrock/third-party-models/)

**Note:** For consumer-facing use, Anthropic’s Usage Policy requires disclosing that users are interacting with AI at the beginning of each session. CoWork-OSS shows an explicit “AI system” disclosure when starting a new task/session.

## Trademark notice
“Cowork” is an Anthropic product name. CoWork-OSS is an independent open-source project and is not affiliated with Anthropic.
If requested by the rights holder, we will update naming/branding to avoid confusion.

## Telegram Bot Integration

CoWork-OSS supports running tasks remotely via a Telegram bot. This allows you to interact with your agent from anywhere using Telegram.

### Setting Up the Telegram Bot

#### 1. Create a Bot with BotFather

1. Open Telegram and search for [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
2. Send `/newbot` and follow the prompts to create your bot
3. Copy the bot token (looks like `123456789:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrsTUVwxyz`)

#### 2. Configure in CoWork-OSS

1. Open CoWork-OSS and go to **Settings** (gear icon)
2. Navigate to the **Channels** tab
3. Enter your bot token and click **Add Telegram Channel**
4. Test the connection, then enable the channel

### Security Modes

Choose the appropriate security mode for your use case:

| Mode | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Pairing** (default) | Users must enter a pairing code generated in the app | Personal use, shared devices |
| **Allowlist** | Only pre-approved Telegram user IDs can interact | Team use with known users |
| **Open** | Anyone can use the bot | ⚠️ Not recommended |

### Pairing Your Telegram Account

1. In CoWork-OSS Settings → Channels, click **Generate Pairing Code**
2. Open your Telegram bot and send the pairing code
3. Once paired, you can start using the bot

### Bot Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/workspaces` | List all available workspaces |
| `/workspace <number>` | Select a workspace by number |
| `/status` | Show current session status |
| `/cancel` | Cancel the running task |

### Using the Bot

1. **Select a workspace**: Send `/workspaces` to see available folders, then `/workspace 1` to select one
2. **Create a task**: Simply type your request (e.g., "organize my downloads by file type")
3. **Monitor progress**: The bot will stream updates as the task executes
4. **View results**: Final results are sent when the task completes

### Example Conversation

```
You: /workspaces
Bot: 📂 Available workspaces:
     1. ~/Documents/project-a
     2. ~/Downloads

You: /workspace 1
Bot: ✓ Workspace selected: ~/Documents/project-a

You: List all TypeScript files and count the lines of code
Bot: 🔄 Task created... [streaming updates]
Bot: ✓ Found 23 TypeScript files with 4,521 total lines of code.
```

### Markdown Support

The bot converts responses to Telegram-compatible formatting:
- Tables are displayed as code blocks for readability
- Bold text and code formatting are preserved
- If formatting fails, plain text is sent as fallback

### Hot Reload

Development mode provides hot reload for both:
- React UI (Vite HMR)
- Electron main process (auto-restart on changes)

### Adding New Tools

1. Define tool schema in `tools/registry.ts`
2. Implement tool logic in `tools/file-tools.ts` or create new file
3. Register tool in `getTools()` method
4. Add execution handler in `executeTool()`

### Adding New Skills

1. Create skill implementation in `skills/` directory
2. Add skill tool definition in `tools/skill-tools.ts`
3. Implement the skill method in SkillTools class

---

## Troubleshooting

### "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not found"

Set the environment variable in your `.env` file or export it:
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
npm run dev
```

### Electron won't start

Clear cache and rebuild:
```bash
rm -rf node_modules dist
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Database locked

Close all instances of the app and delete the lock file:
```bash
rm ~/Library/Application\ Support/cowork-oss/cowork-oss.db-journal
```
